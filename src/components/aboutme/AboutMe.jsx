                My name is Edgardo Arteaga, I am Computer Science major graduating May 2024.
                I specialize in mobile application, specifically IOS development. I reallly enjoy
                working with tech whether it be hardware or software. Apart from my tech hobbies I am a big mixed
                martial arts fan and used to wrestle and box in high school. I am big fan of the UFC and boxing and love watching the sport.
                I also have a passion for music and play the piano, guitar, bass, and sing a little. I also enjoy building things and have experience working 
                in construction so I enjoy woodworking and home improvement projects.I am happily married and recently had my first child.
